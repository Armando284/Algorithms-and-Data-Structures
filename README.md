# Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to the **Algorithms and Data Structures** repository! This is a personal collection of code, notes, and experiments focused on deepening my understanding of key concepts in algorithms, data structures, and design patterns. If you‚Äôre a fellow developer looking to brush up on these topics or just curious about how certain techniques are implemented, you‚Äôre in the right place.

## üöÄ What You'll Find

This repository is structured to serve as both a **learning tool** and a **reference guide**. It‚Äôs divided into three major areas:

### 1. **Algorithms**

- Explore essential algorithms such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.
- Includes implementations of compression algorithms like **RLE**, **LZ77**, and **Gzip**.
- Real-world applications of these algorithms, including **optimization in web development**.

### 2. **Data Structures**

- Implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures such as:
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees.
  - More complex structures like **Doubly Linked Lists** and **LRU caches**.
- Each data structure comes with examples and notes explaining its usage and performance.

### 3. **Design Patterns**

- Patterns implemented with real-life use cases in mind, making it easier to understand where and when to apply them.
- Some of the patterns covered include:
  - **Singleton**, **Observer**, **Strategy**, and others.
- Emphasis on the **practicality** of these patterns, particularly in web development scenarios.

## üî• Highlights

- **Hands-on Practice:** All code is written in TypeScript and thoroughly documented to explain the logic behind each implementation.
- **Notes and Insights:** I document key takeaways from solving problems, along with the challenges faced and how they were overcome.
- **Interview Prep:** Many of the algorithms and structures here are commonly asked in technical interviews, especially for roles in companies like FAANG.
- **Web Development Focus:** Special attention is given to how these algorithms and structures can be applied to modern web development, such as **cache optimization** and handling large datasets efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **TypeScript:** Strongly-typed implementations to ensure better code quality and easier debugging.
- **ESLint:** Code style and quality enforcement with custom rules to avoid bad practices.
  
## üóÇÔ∏è How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Armando284/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder and explore the directories. Each folder contains a specific topic (algorithms, data structures, patterns), with code examples and notes:

   ```bash
   cd Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
   ```

3. Feel free to run, modify, or extend the examples. You can use any TypeScript-compatible IDE for a smooth experience.

## ü§ù Contributions

This repository is primarily for personal practice, but contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, new algorithms, or better patterns, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## üìö Resources

Some of the key resources I‚Äôve referenced while working on this project include:

- **Books:** "Cracking the Coding Interview", "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".
- **Websites:** LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Awwwards.
